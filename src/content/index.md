      After getting a letter from the IRS stating I owed them over $10k I was terrified and started looking at crypto tax software options. There are several options out there but I picked TaxBit because I’d heard them suggested by others and I liked that they had the option to get a CPA review. I am so glad I picked TaxBit. Their customer support is top-notch… Thanks to TaxBit I was able to respond to the IRS appropriately and ended up not owing anything. Thank you TaxBit!

      I received the most incredible service from TaxBit. With several different softwares out there, I felt most comfortable working with a company that employs onstaff CPA’s and cryptocurrency tax attorneys… TaxBit makes it simple to connect your exchanges and generate your required tax forms. The pricing was perfect and very reasonable, especially compared to others (most of which don't have the expertise in this space). It's so important to work with experts in the crypto tax space - they are experts. I will be using them for years to come!

      TaxBit was a life saver!!  I had two years of back Crypto taxes and very minimal record keeping on my part so I was in big trouble, but when I found TaxBit it allowed me to connect the api from all the crypto exchanges that I used to its interface and it seamlessly calculated all the taxes I owed!
