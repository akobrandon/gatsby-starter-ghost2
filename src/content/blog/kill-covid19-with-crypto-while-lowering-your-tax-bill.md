We are a team, we are a community. And now, we can help change the way the world views cryptocurrency.

We are facing the worst pandemic of the modern era. Public health experts sounded the alarm about COVID-19 for weeks, if not months, now, we must take action.

We have an  opportunity to support the organizations serving at the front lines to fight COVID-19.

* [Team Rubicon](https://teamrubiconusa.org/neighbors/): Veterans serving in communities across the country providing assistance such as delivery service for food-insecure populations, coordination and logistics support for those in temporary quarantine
* [Save the Children](https://www.savethechildren.org/us/what-we-do/emergency-response/coronavirus-outbreak): Training health teams worldwide how to protect themselves and prevent further spread of the disease. They are also supplying the personal protective equipment and other supplies frontline health staff desperately need. In addition, They are protecting children and families that may be separated due to quarantine.
* [No Kid Hungry](https://www.nokidhungry.org/coronavirus): Work with federal and local government to support children in need, provide emergency grants to food banks and community groups, divert resources to help the hardest-hit communities, make sure families know how to find meals while schools are closed and continue their work to ensure every kid gets three meals a day.
* And [many more](https://bitcointuesday.org/covid19/)

It is time for us to band together as a community to support those in need.

Today, donating cryptocurrency is no longer just a way to lower our taxes. It is our chance to protect the people we love.

Industry leaders are coming together to form the [\#cryptoCOVID19Alliance](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cryptoCOVID19&src=typed_query). The Giving Block has partnered with Gitcoin, Brave, Gemini, TaxBit, Axiom Finance, Electric Coin Company, Node40, Reciprocity Trading, Meta Cartel, Celsius, Blockchair and more. All united by our common goal to rise up and use cryptocurrency to squash the coronavirus. Now, we need your help.

**Tax Benefits of Donating Cryptocurrency**

Donating cryptocurrency to a registered nonprofit is not a taxable event in the US and many other countries around the world. That means you do not pay capital gains tax and can write the donation off on your taxes, making it one of the most tax efficient ways to support your favorite cause.
