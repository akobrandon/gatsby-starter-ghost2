Wow! What a start to 2021 - weâ€™ve seen bulls at play, with Bitcoin hitting all-time highs and a spectacular interest in cryptocurrency - even Elon Musk got in on the [action](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-says-bitcoin-verge-081930173.html)!

Tax season kicked off in January, aka our busiest time of year. You may start to receive 1099s from the exchanges that you use, with 1099-Bs delivered on/by February 15th. No matter the variation of 1099 you receive, we make navigating crypto taxes easy by automating the entire process. [Sign in](https://taxbit.com/) to your TaxBit account, link your exchanges and wallets to seamlessly pull your transactions, run the appropriate calculations, and auto-generate your tax forms for the 2020 tax year.

### Calling all DeFi enthusiasts! 

We're excited to announce two new features, Tax Optimizer and the beta launch of [DeFi support](https://help.taxbit.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500002196941-DeFi-What-does-TaxBit-s-DeFi-Tool-Do-) for our Plus+ and Pro customers. In addition to DeFi and automating your taxes, TaxBit provides crypto enthusiasts with real-time portfolio tracking and tax optimization visibility so that you can make tax optimized crypto trades throughout the year. To give you a chance to take the Tax Optimizer for a spin we've made it available for a limited time to all customers.
