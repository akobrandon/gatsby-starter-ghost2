It’s tax season and many taxpayers will receive tax forms from cryptocurrency exchanges. Due to some confusion in the industry, some taxpayers may receive a form 1099-K, others will receive a form 1099-B, and some may receive nothing at all. Whatever situation you fall under, TaxBit is skilled in helping.

**Form 1099-K**

A couple of cryptocurrency exchanges have issued 1099-K’s, which is an informational return that sums up the total value a user has received throughout the year. This form leads to reporting of income when no income was actually generated on the exchange. [If you receive a 1099-K from a cryptocurrency exchange then you will also likely receive an IRS CP2000 letter for unreported income in the future.](https://taxbit.com/blog/2020-01-13-responding-to-a-cryptocurrency-irs-cp2000-letter/)

Cryptocurrency exchanges that have issued 1099-K’s report only the total value transacted, but do not include proper adjustments for cost basis. For example, if a user purchases $100,000 of cryptocurrency and then sells it a month later for $90,000, then both the user and the IRS will receive a 1099-K showing income received of $90,000 (assuming the taxpayer meets the 200 transaction threshold). Form 1099-K is intended for taxpayers who generate income on a platform, such as Ebay and Etsy sellers. Accordingly, the amount listed on the 1099-K will be much higher than a taxpayer will actually owe.

Most taxpayers correctly don’t report the inflated 1099-K amount as income on their tax return. As a result, the IRS cross checks the 1099-K against the taxpayers income and then issues a CP2000 audit letter for failing to report the income. Worse yet, TaxBit has helped many taxpayers whose accountants weren’t aware that their client’s 1099-K was inaccurate and actually reported the amount listed on a taxpayer's 1099-K as income. Many exchanges have stopped issuing 1099-K’s due to the IRS auditing their users for unreported income. If you received a 1099-K then TaxBit can help you resolve any audits or issues you encounter related to the 1099-K tax form.

**Form 1099-B**

Form 1099-B was designed for capital assets. This form shows proceeds from each transaction, as well as cost basis when available. Form 1099-B has long been used in the equity and commodity space for brokers of capital assets. Form 1099-B is designed to be transposed onto an IRS 8949 (the tax form cryptocurrency traders are required to file).

Gains reported on a 1099-B are taxed pursuant to capital gains treatment instead of ordinary income. Many exchanges are seeing the problems 1099-K’s have caused and are beginning to issue 1099-B’s due to the nature of cryptocurrency being taxed as a capital asset. Issuing Form 1099-B leads to more accurate tax reporting and eliminates the automatic IRS audits for unreported income which are issued to recipients of form 1099-K.

If you only traded on a single exchange and were issued a Form 1099-B, then the tax form will be complete and you can transpose the information onto your IRS 8949. If you traded on multiple exchanges, then Form 1099-B may not report capture all of your cost basis from other cryptocurrency exchanges. TaxBit can help you aggregate your data across exchanges and resolve any missing cost basis transactions.

**Conclusion**

Whether you were issued a 1099-K, 1099-B, or weren’t issued any tax form at all, TaxBit can help ensure you are tax compliant.
