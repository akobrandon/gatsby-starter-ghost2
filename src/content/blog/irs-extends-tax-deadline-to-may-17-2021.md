The IRS just announced they are [extending](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-day-for-individuals-extended-to-may-17-treasury-irs-extend-filing-and-payment-deadline) the Tax Deadline for individuals to May 17, 2021. This new deadline doesn’t mean you should put off filing your taxes— nearly 75% of all Americans are eligible to receive a refund. This means the sooner you file, the sooner you'll receive your refund! Last year nearly three out of four tax filers received a tax refund averaging nearly $3,000! The IRS [states](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/2021-tax-filing-season-begins-feb-12-irs-outlines-steps-to-speed-refunds-during-pandemic) that taxpayers can receive their tax refunds within 21 days of acceptance when filing electronically with direct deposit.
