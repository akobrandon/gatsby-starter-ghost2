A whopping [57 million people](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2018/08/31/57-million-u-s-workers-are-part-of-the-gig-economy/?sh=55efead67118) in the U.S. participate in the gig economy. If you do, chances are, your livelihood depends on getting paid by your clients on time.

## Benefits of Gig Workers Getting Paid in Cryptocurrency

Gig workers can point to several perks of being their own boss: Unlimited vacation, flexibility, choice of jobs and more.

The pain points can sometimes be felt more acutely for gig workers. For example, [58% of freelancers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/abdullahimuhammed/2018/04/24/shocker-58-of-freelancers-have-experienced-not-getting-paid-study-shows/#46f97ffc175e) have experienced not getting paid for completing a particular job.

The solution: They can use smart contracts, a blockchain-based technology that enforces contracts without the need of a third party.

What is blockchain? Blockchain is a distributed network of providers and users. Blockchain technology facilitates fast, secure, low-cost international payment processing services (and other transactions) through encrypted distributed ledgers that provide trusted transactions without intermediaries like banks and clearing houses.

You can use it for just about any transaction, from rent collection for tenants to using it as a worker in the gig economy.

That begs the question: What is cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency (also called crypto) is a digital currency that you can use to buy goods and services. Crypto uses an online ledger with strong cryptography to secure online transactions — the blockchain.

## Why You Should Consider Getting Paid with Cryptocurrencies

Why opt for getting paid with cryptocurrency? Check out a few more great reasons.

### Reason 1: Getting paid in bitcoin or other crypto is fast and efficient.

Cryptocurrency lets you bypass existing banking infrastructure with the goal of accelerating payments and reducing costs Banks and other payment services can take several working days, fees and fees for currency exchange rates. With crypto, you get paid in minutes and don’t pay any fees.

### Reason 2: You can work anywhere.

Crypto allows you to work from anywhere in the world because it doesn’t require you to live in a certain country to receive payment. In that case, why not sell your skills on the global market? You never know — you might be able to tap into higher pay rates and jobs.

### Reason 3: Small jobs suddenly become worth it.

Afraid to take small jobs because you’ll get hit with crazy fees and it no longer seems worth it? Cryptocurrencies like Litecoin allow transactions for minute amounts, like $0.02 to $0.03.

## How to Get Paid in Crypto if You’re a Gig Worker

Hooked? Glued to the fact that your clients can never “stiff” you again? Here’s how to get paid in crypto if you’re a gig worker.

### Tip 1: Check the freelance marketplaces.

Check into your existing freelance marketplace to find out whether you can get paid for services, particularly if you’re seeking jobs in other countries. Exchanging cryptographic money instead of local currencies sometimes makes more sense, and you’ll pay extra for PayPal, Square and others.

### Tip 2: Check your affiliate programs.

Do you gain a commission when you push other companies’ products? Anytime you send out an email or social media post and connect users to others’ products, it’s called affiliate marketing.

Find out whether your affiliate programs offer blockchain payments.

### Tip 3: Write about crypto in exchange for crypto.

Many websites and blogs offer you crypto in exchange for writing about digital assets. New startups might offer you crypto to elevate their promotional and website content (particularly bitcoin-related online networking posts and more).
