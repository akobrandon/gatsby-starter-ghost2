At TaxBit, we have a culture of caring. This is evident not only in our everyday interactions within the office, but also in the way our team members engage the community. Most recently, our team members volunteered at the [Utah Food Bank,](https://www.utahfoodbank.org/) a nonprofit organization with a mission to fight hunger statewide.

Due to the small number of employees at the food bank, most of the work is done by volunteers. In fact, the total number of volunteer work hours last year was equivalent to that of 58 full-time employees’ hours. The Food Bank relies on these volunteers to continue to fight hunger in Utah, and the TaxBit team couldn’t have been more grateful to contribute.

The volunteer activity was led by Felippe Oppe, Accounting & Tax SME Manager at TaxBit. To Felippe, who spent his childhood in Brazil, the Food Bank’s mission hit particularly close to home. 

> “The fight against hunger is especially important to me. I grew up in a third-world country where many people do not know where their next meal will come from,” explained Felippe. “However, this problem is not only seen in third-world countries. This problem is around us. We never know who needs help -- it might be the family next door to us, and one day it might be our own family. That’s why I believe in giving when I can, even if just a couple hours of my day.”

Following Felippe’s lead, the TaxBit Team took some time to help sort through large boxes of canned and boxed foods, examining for damage and passed expiration dates, and preparing for shipment.

Not only was our team helping fight hunger, it was also an opportunity for us to get to know each other better over a shared experience -- stories were shared, jokes were told, and the laughter was endless. We’re grateful for a chance to build friendships and give back to the community.
