TaxBit is happy to announce the recent hire of CPA and cryptocurrency tax subject matter expert, Seth Wilks. Wilks is regarded as a leading expert on cryptocurrency tax matters. Wilks has been heavily involved in educating and informing policy makers and regulators relating to virtual assets. In March 2020, Wilks was recognized as a cryptocurrency tax specialist and served as a panelist at the IRS’ invite-only Virtual Currency Summit at the IRS’ headquarters in Washington, DC.



Wilks brings a broad perspective, having started his career as a Tax Consultant at “Big Four” accounting firm EY, to leading global tax departments for Fender Musical Instruments, P.F. Chang’s China Bistro, and Clarus Corporation (Black Diamond Equipment). Over the past two years, Wilks has focussed his efforts on developing relationships with key crypto players in the Treasury Dept., the IRS and on Capitol Hill.



Wilks joins TaxBit as its Director of Tax & Accounting SME, where he will leverage his deep cryptocurrency and compliance experience to further solidify TaxBit’s position as a leader in cryptocurrency taxes, accounting, and information reporting. Wilks says, “Although virtual currencies are moving beyond their infant years, the asset class is still relatively young. Technology will play an integral role in automating the regulatory hurdles relating to this unique asset class. TaxBit’s platform is positioned well to provide tax solutions for both industry and global regulators.”
