We’re excited to welcome [Jordan Plater](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanplater/) to the TaxBit team as Head of Sales. Plater will be leading the enterprise sales and go-to-market efforts globally.

Plater has a B.A. in Business Management and Chinese from Brigham Young University and brings over 12 years of experience in designing effective sales and go-to-market strategies.

Prior to joining TaxBit, Plater played a key role in launching Qualtrics in the Asia-Pacific market, building the go-to-market strategy, and forming and leading the Global Strategic Accounts Team.

His in-depth knowledge of the financial services space, experience building and scaling sales teams, and passion for solving customers’ challenges is the perfect combination for this role.

Plater had worked alongside TaxBit CEO Austin Woodward at Qualtrics for years and is pleased to be working alongside him again. “I actually recruited Austin to Qualtrics in 2013, where we worked together for years,” said Plater. “Now, I couldn’t be more excited to work alongside Austin again, leading sales efforts for TaxBit during a time of rapid growth. TaxBit is leading the industry while solving real issues for consumers, enterprises, and governments, and I’m thrilled to be a part of the team.”
