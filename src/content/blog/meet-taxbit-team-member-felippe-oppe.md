At TaxBit, our team is the pulse that keeps our company moving forward. Every employee brings a unique perspective and skillset, and we wouldn’t be where we are today without them! In our TaxBit Team Spotlight Series, we’ll get to know the team members behind our success a bit better. This week, we’d like to introduce you to Felippe Opp, SME Manager at TaxBit. Felippe joined the SME team at TaxBit in 2020.

### Q: Tell us a bit about yourself: Where are you from and what brought you to where you are today?

A: I was born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil. São Paulo is a big city—it has the biggest population of South America. I moved to the U.S. in 2009 when I was 21 years old. My initial goal was to learn English since I didn’t speak one word of English. 

After one year of studying the language I decided to try going to college, attending Brigham Young University (BYU), where I got both my Bachelor’s and Master’s of Accountancy. After graduating, I worked as an external financial auditor for EY, where I focused on banks, broker deals, and investment funds.

### Q: What made you choose TaxBit?

A: TaxBit has incredible potential. The career path here has so many opportunities, and company-wide collaboration. I wanted to help build an industry-leading company and learn from the best in the business in the process. The culture of appreciation, encouragement, and transparency is terrific. We care about each other and ensure we're authentic in our day-to-day work.

### Q: What does your day-to-day look like at TaxBit?

A: Working in the crypto space, every day is something different. I am involved across many areas of the business. I spend part of my day in implementation meetings with existing clients, and then work with our development team to implement the clients’ feedback. We are always iterating and optimizing our offering—this includes creating datasets that our developers can use as examples, and then testing the new features to ensure our app is working as expected.

Research is also an important part of my role. Crypto is an area that is constantly changing and it is my responsibility to keep up with new regulations in the U.S. and internationally, as well as changes in the market like new products or new exchanges.

I also collaborate with our customer support team to help answer questions that are very technical, and investigate problems with customer accounts to find the root of the problem and the solution.

Of course, I always make time to play ping-pong and have some fun in the office!

### Q: What’s your favorite part of working at TaxBit?

A: My favorite part of working at TaxBit is the culture of appreciation and care. Everyone is always willing to jump in and help, and often cross-departmental. The collaboration and help doesn’t go unnoticed, and it’s clear we all really care about each other here.

### Q: What’s your favorite part of working in crypto?

A: The potential. Crypto will dominate the financial industry, and we are just at the very beginning. We are guiding the growth of a whole new industry and play an important part in driving and defining a new asset class.

### Q: Outside of work, what are some fun things you like to do?

A: Since I’m from Brazil, you can probably guess one of my favorite activities is soccer. I play soccer a few times throughout the week and also love to ride my motorcycle in the canyons, especially on warm Sundays.

### Q: If you could travel anywhere, where would it be?

A: Italy has always been my dream vacation. I love history and Italy is full of history. And, my ancestors migrated from Italy to Brazil, so I would love to see the small cities they came from.

### Speed round:

**Favorite movie**: Lord of the Rings. I like the battle scenes and the magical world.

**Go-to karaoke song**: Good question. I don’t think I have one—I'm up for anything.

**Favorite food:** I love a good barbecue. Smoking meat is an art.

**Current Netflix binge:** Peaky Blinders.
