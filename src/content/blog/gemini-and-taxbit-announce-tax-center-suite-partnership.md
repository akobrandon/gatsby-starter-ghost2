TaxBit is excited to announce that prominent cryptocurrency exchange [Gemini will integrate Tax Center Suites](https://gemini.com/blog/gemini-and-taxbit-partner-to-make-crypto-taxes-easier) in the coming months. [TaxBit’s Tax Center Suite technology](https://taxbit.com/enterprise) will provide Gemini users with an end-to-end suite of tax tools within user accounts on Gemini.



Gemini’s CEO Tyler Winklevoss commented “TaxBit’s software automates the calculations required for crypto tax reporting, helping reduce the pain point of crypto taxes for our users. Investors will also be able to see real-time tax implications of any trades they make on Gemini.”



Tax Center Suites provide value beyond completed tax forms. Gemini users will be able to track their real-time tax impact as they trade and actively lower their tax liability (or potentially increase their tax refund) through tax optimization tools. Users will also be able to receive trade alerts when tax saving opportunities are available.



The IRS has reiterated the importance of reporting taxable crypto transactions and Tax Center Suites provides users with transaction level tax reporting to make completing their crypto taxes simple. Users will be able to download a completed tax report that is ready to upload into popular tax filing softwares or hand over to their accountant.



TaxBit is excited to team up with Gemini to provide its users a best-in-class experience when it comes to cryptocurrency taxes. To all of our loyal Gemini users, Onward and Upward!
