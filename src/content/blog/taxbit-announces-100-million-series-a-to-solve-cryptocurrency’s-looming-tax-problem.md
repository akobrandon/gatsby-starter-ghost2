Earlier this week we [announced](https://taxbit.com/blog/taxbit-raises-100-million-to-enable-mainstream-cryptocurrency-adoption/) a record-breaking [$100 Million Series A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHDy5pSXaY) round of funding. 

The past 12-months at TaxBit have been monumental. We launched products like Tax Optimizer and [DeFi support](https://help.taxbit.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500002196941-DeFi-What-does-TaxBit-s-DeFi-Tool-Do-) that remove some of the largest roadblocks in this rapidly growing industry. We are excited to continue to scale world-class tax and accounting products so cryptocurrency can continue to thrive among consumers, enterprises, and governments worldwide.

"The rise of cryptocurrency poses new tax and accounting challenges for individuals, businesses, and governments alike. We believe TaxBit has built the best-in-class solution and are thrilled to be partnering with Austin Woodward and the rest of the TaxBit team," said Matt Huang, Co-Founder Paradigm.
