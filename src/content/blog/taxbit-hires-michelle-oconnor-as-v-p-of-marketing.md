TaxBit is happy to announce the recent hire of former Uphold executive Michelle O'Connor. Michelle was previously the VP of Marketing at Uphold, where she worked closely with the TaxBit team through its partnership.

In her role, Michelle will implement growth strategies to build our communities and help cryptocurrency enterprises and consumers simplify their taxes. We look forward to Michelle leading our marketing team.

Michelle expressed "I've known the TaxBit team since early 2017. We worked closely as strategic partners over the years, and I was an early user. Iâ€™ve watched them build an industry-leading product, and create a culture that cultivates growth and embraces diversity and inclusion. I couldn't be more excited to join the team and help support this rapid phase of growth."
