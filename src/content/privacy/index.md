At TaxBit, we respect and protect your privacy whether you are a consumer using our platform, enterprise hosting a custom tax center, (“the Service” or “Services”) or a visitor to our website. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your Personal Data. The information we collect and use is limited to your use of our Services, whether a customer of TaxBit or not.

**1. What Do We Mean by Personal Data?**

In this Policy, “Personal Data” means any information that identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with, a particular individual, including, but not limited to, his or her name, signature, social security number, physical characteristics or description, address, telephone number, passport number, driver’s license or state identification card number, education, employment, employment history, bank account number, credit card number, debit card number, or any other financial information. Personal Data does not include publicly available information that is lawfully made available to the general public from federal, state, or local government records.

**2. Consumer Personal Data You Provide to Us**

When you register for the a TaxBit Consumer account, the only required Personal Data we ask for is your email address, which becomes your account username, and credit card information. In order to provide you with a more customized and complete experience, we may ask for additional Personal Data such as your name, zip code, and tax demographic information. We also collect Personal Data such as an email address and a name or alias of any agents or end users you authorize to log into and utilize the Service in connection with your account. TaxBit may use the Personal Data you provide to operate the Service, for identification and authentication, to contact and communicate with you and your Agents about the Service, to send marketing materials (subject to the opt-out option), for research purposes, and to generally improve the content and functionality of the Service. We may share your Personal Data with third parties (including our service providers and law enforcement entities) to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues. TaxBit will not sell your Personal Data to any third party.

**3. Enterprise Customers’ Personal Data**

TaxBit provides certain information reporting and Tax Center Offerings for Enterprises. We do not collect publicly identifiable information (PII) on Enterprises' users. We will only collect the transactional information necessary to perform the necessary tax calculations to perform our Services. Enterprises will only need to provide a unique digital identifier that they can tie back to a user's account. TaxBit will only use the necessary information to perform its Services. TaxBit will not sell or disclose such information to any unauthorized third parties.

If a user is both an Enterprise user and a TaxBit Consumer user then they will be subject to both parties' terms of service. 

**4. Usage Data**

We collect information on how you interact with the Services, such as the IP address from which you access the Service, date and time accessed, information about your browser, operating system and computer or device, pages viewed and items clicked. We may also collect location information, including location information automatically provided by your computer or device. We use cookies and similar technologies to collect some of this information. We do not sell Usage Data that can identify a user, either directly or indirectly.

**5. Log Files**

As is true with most websites, TaxBit gathers certain information automatically and generates log files. This information includes internet protocol addresses as well as browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. Occasionally, we may combine Personal Data with information gathered in our log files, as necessary to improve the Service for individual customers. Otherwise, we generally use this information as we would any Usage Data, to analyze trends, administer and maintain the Service, or track usage of various features within the Service.

**6. Cookies**

A cookie is a small software file stored temporarily or placed on your computer’s hard drive. The main purpose of a cookie is to allow a web server to identify a user’s computer and browser, and tailor web pages and/or login information to their preferences. Cookies help us promptly display the information needed to use the capabilities of the Service and other information which we consider to be of interest to visitors to the TaxBit websites and users of the Service. By gathering and remembering information about website preferences through cookies, we can provide a better web and marketing experience. Cookies don’t give us access to users computers, and the information we collect through cookies doesn’t include Personal Data.

When you or your agents or end users use the Service, we utilize session cookies, which allow us to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to process your online transactions. Session cookies disappear from your computer when the web browser is closed or your computer is turned off. We also utilize persistent cookies to identify TaxBit Agents and End Users and make it easier for them to log into and use the Service. Persistent cookies remain on computers after the web browser is closed or the computer is turned off.

We utilize various categories of cookies, which are summarized below along with the options available to you to manage them.

Essential: Essential cookies are those that are critical to the functionality of the Service. We use these cookies to keep an agent or end user logged into the Service and remember relevant information when the agent or end user returns to the Service.

Functional: We use functional cookies to track agents and end users activities in the Service, understand their preferences and improve their user experience. These cookies can also be used to remember configurations of the Service that our customers can customize.

Marketing: We engage third party providers to serve a variety of marketing cookies that enable us to track and analyze usage, navigational and other statistical information from visitors to the TaxBit Websites. This information does not include Personal Data though we may re-associate this information with Personal Data we have collected when it is received. Marketing cookies are also used to track the performance of our advertisements and are employed by third party advertising networks that we utilize. These advertising networks follow online activities of visitors to the TaxBit Websites and use this information to inform, optimize and serve tailored advertisements on the TaxBit Websites or on other websites they visit that we believe would most effectively promote the Service to you. We also use third parties to collect information that assists us in other methods of re-marketing our Service to visitors to the TaxBit Websites, including customized email communications.

You can generally accept or decline the use of cookies through a functionality built into your web browser.

Many jurisdictions require or recommend that website operators inform users as to the nature of cookies they utilize and, in certain circumstances, obtain the consent of their users to the placement of certain cookies. If you are a customer of TaxBit, it is your responsibility to inform the individuals with whom you interact using the Service, including your agents and end users as to the types of cookies utilized in the Service and, as necessary, to obtain their consent. If you require more specific information as to the nature of the cookies utilized in the Service for purposes of fulfilling these obligations, please contact us by email at [privacy@TaxBit.com](mailto:privacy@TaxBit.com).

**7. Web Beacons**

We also may employ web beacons to help us better manage content in the Service by informing us what content is effective. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of internet users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a users computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on websites. We tie the information gathered by web beacons to Personal Data we otherwise collect, and use them in our HTML-based emails to learn which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns as well as to operate and improve the Service. You can opt-out of these emails by following the unsubscribe instructions within such marketing emails.

**8. Do Not Track Signals**

We do not currently respond to web browsers Do Not Track signals that provide a method to opt out of the collection information about visitors activities on the TaxBit Website and Service, and across other websites. If we do so in the future, we will provide all relevant information in this Policy.

**9. Use of Your Information**

In the course of business, we may hire third party individuals and organizations to help us make the TaxBit Services better. These third parties include our web host provider, other SaaS providers, such as an email hosting service, payment processors, or outside contractors we hire to perform marketing, maintenance, or assist us in securing our website. We may also hire third parties to operate, maintain, repair, or otherwise improve and preserve our website or its underlying files or systems.

However, we do not sell client, or prospective client, identifiable information – including the fact that you are or may become a TaxBit client – to anyone.

TaxBit may disclose Personal Data only to those of its employees and third party organizations that (1) need to know such information in order to process it on TaxBit’s behalf or to provide services as described above and (2) have agreed not to disclose it to any other parties without TaxBit’s consent. Some of those employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Site and/or the Service, you consent to the transfer of information to such individuals and organizations in order to accomplish these purposes.

In order to calculate your tax liability it is necessary to provide identifying information about you to companies, individuals, or groups that are not affiliated with TaxBit. For example, Users consent to TaxBit using their Application Programming Interface (APIs) from exchanges. This allows TaxBit to receive information about you from other sources.

We may use anonymized and/or aggregated data about our Users to help understand how our products and services are being used or to market or promote the products and services.

Before using or sharing your information with non-agent third parties in ways not discussed here or previously authorized by you, we will provide you Notice and an opportunity to control the further use or disclosure of your Personal Data.

TaxBit is committed to ensuring the security of your Personal Data. We utilize appropriate precautions to protect the confidentiality and security of the Personal Data within the Service by employing technical, physical, and organizational safeguards and carefully-developed security procedures.

These technologies, procedures, and other measures are used in an effort to ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you authorized to access your data. However, no internet, e-mail or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take care in deciding what information you send to us in this way.
