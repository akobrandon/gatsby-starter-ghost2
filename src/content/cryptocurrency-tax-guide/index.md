## Our commitment to you:

As a TaxBit user, you have entrusted us with your relevant personal and financial data. We recognize that your relationship with us is based on trust, and that you expect us to act responsibly and in your best interests. Because your personal and financial data are your private information, we hold ourselves to the highest standards in their safekeeping and use.

This means, most importantly, that we do not sell client or prospective client information – whether or not it is your personal information or the fact that you are or may become to TaxBit client – to anyone.

Instead, we use your information primarily to complete track trades and tax liability, generate 1099 tax forms, and in furtherance of other services we offer or sponsor. The information shared will only be used by our company, or an affiliate company in furtherance of our services.

## The personal information we collect about you:

You provide personal information when you complete a TaxBit account application. (If you enter information in an online account application, we may store the information even if you don’t complete or submit the application.)

In addition to personal information you provide to use, we may receive information about you that you authorize third parties to provide to us. We may also obtain personal information from third-party service providers in order to verify your identity, to prevent fraud, or to help us identify products and services that may be of interest to you. Personal information collected from any source may include, among other things, your name and address, Social Security or taxpayer identification number, date of birth, assets, trade history, income, account balances, investment activity, and accounts at other institutions. The information we collect about you may be transferred or stored by TaxBit or our service providers in the United States or elsewhere, as permitted by law.

We may combine the information collected on our website or through our mobile application with information collected from or about you in other contexts. This may include information collected online, such as through our email exchanges with you, or from offline sources, such as information that we collect when you establish your account with us or call customer service. We will treat such combined information in accordance with this policy. If you do not wish to provide information to TaxBit, we may be unable to provide certain services to you. 

## How we handle your personal information:

We do not sell personal information about current or former clients or their accounts to third parties. Nor do we share personal information about clients or prospective clients, except when needed to further the services we offer.

* In order to calculate your tax liability it is necessary to provide identifying information about you to companies, individuals, or groups that are not affiliated with TaxBit. For example, Users consent to TaxBit using their Application Programming Interface (APIs) from exchanges. This allows TaxBit to receive information about you from other sources.
* In certain instances, we may contract with nonaffiliated companies to perform services for us. Where necessary, we will disclose information we have about you to these third parties. In all such cases, we provide the third party with only the personal information necessary to carry out its assigned responsibilities, and only for that purpose. And we require these third parties to treat your personal information with the same high degree of confidentiality that we do.
* Finally, we will release information about you if you direct or authorize us to do so, if we are compelled by law to do so, or in other legally limited circumstances (for example, to prevent fraud).
