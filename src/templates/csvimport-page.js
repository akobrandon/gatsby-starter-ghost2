                      <p>
                        To get started, you will want to <a href="/assets/csv/CSVuploadExample.xlsx" target="_blank">download</a> TaxBitâ€™s template file so you can see exactly how your data needs to be formatted. The template file contains highlighted rows of example data that is properly formatted. In this tutorial, we will add our data in the rows beneath the example data, and then delete the example data rows once we are finished entering our data.

                        <p>We will go through each of the columns in the template. Make sure that you don't edit any of the column headers names or position, as they need to be left exactly as they are in order for your file to properly upload.</p>

                        <p>If you exported your data from an exchange, some exchanges label everything as buy or sale, including crypto to crypto trades. You need to make sure to change the transaction type to trade if your transaction consisted of trading one cryptocurrency for another. </p>

                      <p>This needs to be the 3-4 character currency symbol of what you gave up, which should be a fiat currency symbol in the case of the transaction type buy, and a cryptocurrency symbol in the cases of the transaction types trade or sale.</p>

                      <p>This column is optional, but is good to include if you want to be able to sort and filter your transactions by source in your TaxBit account. You can enter the name of the exchange or wallet the currency was sent from.</p>

                      <p>Most exchanges charge fees to transact. If you bought cryptocurrency then it is allowable to add fees into your cost basis and if you "Sell" or "Trade" you can deduct fees from your proceeds. This is beneficial because it will lower your resulting gains or increase your losses. Enter your transaction fees in this column and we will handle the rest!</p>
